# Translator
The project is a basic java app that translates text from english to bulgarian and vice versa. 
It uses two files containing bulgarain and english words. The algorithm find the row of the user- entered word and goes on finding the word at the same row in the other text document. 
It is possible for the translator to learn new words by using the "Input" function. It adds the word and its translation to the original files. 
Once restarted, the application is going to give the translation of the new word had entered previously in the dictionary. 
The dictionary can only add one word and one translation at a time. If the user tries to enter more than one word 
an error window will pop up.
